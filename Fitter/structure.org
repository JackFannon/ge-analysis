* Structure of fitting program
** Outline
- Load in the raw data
  - Load the channel vs counts data from the raw data files
  - Fill a histogram with the channel vs counts
- Calibrate the raw histogram
  - Using the slope and intercept values from the Ni calibration, re-bin the raw histogram so that the x-axis now represents energy in MeV.
  - This requires a new histogram object and looping over the bins to re-bin it.
- Fit the K40, C60 and Tl208 peaks in the now calibrated histogram.
  - Uses the energy of the decays to locate the peaks.
- Loop over the energy range where the LINAC peak should be
  - Each loop opens the next MC file for that specific energy (x value)
